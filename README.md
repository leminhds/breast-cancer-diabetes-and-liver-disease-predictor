This project aims to help doctors and patients to have a second opinion about their test results. In the U.S, certain results, like for breast cancer, need to be looked at by at least 2 doctors. This app aims to take a first step at reducing the burden of the healthcare system. For each result, a prediction is given, along with a note about the model accuracy during training.

Depending on whether you want to have a second opinion for breast cancer, diabetes, or liver disease, different information will be required. Most of these required parameter should be standardized in relevant test results. Still, different countries and different medical practice has different measuring practice.
